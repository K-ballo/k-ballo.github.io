_Const-correctness_ is the form of program correctness that deals with the proper declaration of objects as _mutable_ or _immutable_. The idea of _constness_ is a compile-time enforced construct that indicates what a programmer should do, it communicates information about a value's intended use: whether something may or may not be modified. Embedding such intent by means of a _keyword_ will result in clearer, easier to follow code; and if you happen to stray from the declared intent the compiler will step up and make you think twice about what you are trying to do.

# Being `const`

When the _`const`-qualifier_ is applied to a declaration it results in something that is _immutable_.

 - `const` in objects:
   
   An object that is declared `const` is _immutable_. Its value cannot be changed, thus its value will always be the one with which the object was initialized.

 - `const` in pointers/references:
   
   A pointer/reference to `const` does not need to point/refer to a  `const` object, but it is treated as if it does. The pointer/reference cannot be used to modify the pointee/referenced, even if the object pointed to/referenced is a _non-`const`_ object that can be modified through some other access path.

 - `const` in member functions:

   A member function that is declared `const` results in a member function that can't change the observable state of the object that contains it. The _`const`-qualifier_ applies to the _implicit `this`_ argument.
   
 - `const` in function arguments:

   As function argument types _decay_, top level _`const`-qualifiers_ are removed. It is the copy of the parameters that are `const` and not the parameters passed to it, it only affects the way in which such parameter copies can be used within the declaration of  that function.

   The following two definitions are in fact defining the same function, which is an error:
   
        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        void foo( int p ){ }
        void foo( int const p ){ }

## _bitwise_ vs _logical_

The idea of _constness_ does not imply that the variable as it is stored in the computer's memory is unwriteable _(bitwise constness)_, but rather than its logical state does not change _(logical constness)_. Sometimes an object logical state does not change, but its bits do (think of an object that provides reference count, cache, etc). Such thing is accomplished by the use of the `mutable` keyword.

> **[7.1.1/10]**
> The `mutable` specifier can be applied only to names of class data members (9.2) and cannot be applied to names declared `const` or `static`, and cannot be applied to reference members. _[ Example:_

> **[7.1.1/11]**

A member object that is declared as _mutable_ can always be changed, even inside a `const` member function or by a pointer/reference to `const`.

## So you want to shoot yourself in the foot

Another alternative to bypass intention is to _cast the constness away_ by means of `const_cast`. By using it, its possible to turn a pointer/reference to a _`const`_ object into one to a _non-`const`_ object. It's also possible to go the other way and turn a pointer/reference to a _non-`const`_ object into a _`const`_ one, but that is less common since such conversion is a _standard conversion_ that can be done implicitly.

But there is a caveat:

> **[7.1.6.1/4]**
> Except that any class member declared `mutable` (7.1.1) can be modified, any attempt to modify a `const` object during its lifetime (3.8) results in undefined behavior.

A `static const` object with no `mutable` subobjects that is initialized with a _constant expression_ may be placed in a _read-only_ memory location (either _ROM_ or otherwise enforced). If you _cast the constness away_ of one of those objects and then try to modify it, you have _undefined behavior_. This situation is more common than it may initially seem, specially when dealing with _string literals_

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    char const* some_string = "Hello World?";
    const_cast< char* >( some_string )[11] = '!'; // we need const_cast here or the compiler will complain

Take a look at what is going on there, we are declaring a _string literal_ `"Hello World?"`

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    static char const __hello_world_literal[] = "Hello World?";

we take a pointer to it

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    char const* some_string = __hello_world_literal;

and then we _cast the constness away_ and try to modify it

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    const_cast< char* >( some_string )[11] = '!';

And, trying to modify something in _read-only_ memory is &mdash;of course&mdash; _undefined behavior_. This will usually, but not necessary, result in a crash when executed.

_String literals_ happens to be one of those places where _C_ and _C++_ differ, being `const` in _C++_ and not in _C_:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    char* p = "abc"; // valid in C, invalid in C++

Some _C++_ compilers will, perhaps for backwards compatibility reasons, allow such invalid code by essentially adding an implicit `const_cast`. Now we have the same kind of _undefined behavior_, but without any of the compiler errors nor the ugly `const_cast` hinting that it should be handled with care.

# `const` implies _thread-safe_

This is what the _Standard Language_ has to say on thread-safety:

> **[1.10/4]**
> Two expression evaluations _conflict_ if one of them modifies a memory location (1.7) and the other one accesses or modifies the same memory location.
>
> **[1.10/21]**
> The execution of a program contains a _data race_ if it contains two conflicting actions in different threads, at least one of which is not atomic, and neither happens before the other. Any such data race results in undefined behavior.

which is nothing else than the sufficient condition for a _data race_ to occur:

 1. There are two or more actions being performed at the same time on a given thing; and
 2. At least one of them is a write.

The _Standard Library_ builds on that, going a bit further:

> **[17.6.5.9/1]**
> This section specifies requirements that implementations shall meet to prevent data races (1.10). Every standard library function shall meet each requirement unless otherwise specified. Implementations may prevent data races in cases other than those specified below.
>
> **[17.6.5.9/3]**
> A C++ standard library function shall not directly or indirectly modify objects (1.10) accessible by threads other than the current thread unless the objects are accessed directly or indirectly via the function’s non-**const** arguments, including `this`.

which in simple words says that it expects operations on `const` objects to be _thread-safe_. This means that the _Standard Library_ won't introduce a data race as long as operations on `const` objects of your own types either

 1. Consist entirely of reads &mdash;that is, there are no writes&mdash;; or
 2. Internally synchronizes writes.

If this expectation does not hold for one of your types, then using it directly or indirectly together with any component of the _Standard Library_ may result in a _data race_. In conclusion, `const` does mean _thread-safe_ from the _Standard Library_ point of view. It is important to note that this is merely a _contract_ and it won't be enforced by the compiler, if you break it you get _undefined behavior_ and you are on your own. Whether `const` is present or not will not affect code generation &mdash;at least not in respect to _data races_&mdash;.

## `const` is no `synchronized`

Consider the following overly simplified class representing a rectangle:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class rect {
        int width = 0, height = 0;
    
    public:
        /*...*/
        void set_size( int new_width, int new_height ) {
            width = new_width;
            height = new_height;
        }
        int area() const {
            return width * height;
        }
    };

The _member-function_ `area` is _thread-safe_; not because its `const`, but because it consist entirely of read operations. There are no writes involved, and at least one write involved is necessary for a _data race_ to occur. That means that you can call `area` from as many threads as you want and you will get correct results all the time.

Note that this doesn't mean that `rect` is _thread-safe_. In fact, its easy to see how if a call to `area` were to happen at the same time that a call to `set_size` on a given `rect`, then `area` could end up computing its result based on an old width and a new height (or even on garbled values).

But that is alright, `rect` isn't `const` so its not even expected to be _thread-safe_ after all. An object declared `const rect`, on the other hand, would be _thread-safe_ since no writes are possible (and if you are considering `const_cast`-ing something originally declared `const` then you get _undefined-behavior_ and that's it).

## So what does it mean then?

 Let's assume &mdash;for the sake of argument&mdash; that multiplication operations are extremely costly and we better avoid them when possible. We could compute the area only if it is requested, and then cache it in case it is requested again in the future:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class rect {
        int width = 0, height = 0;

        mutable int cached_area = 0;
        mutable bool cached_area_valid = true;

    public:
        /*...*/
        void set_size( int new_width, int new_height ) {
            cached_area_valid = ( width == new_width && height == new_height );
            width = new_width;
            height = new_height;
        }
        int area() const {
            if( !cached_area_valid ) {
                cached_area = width;
                cached_area *= height;
                cached_area_valid = true;
            }
            return cached_area;
        }
    };

[If this example seems too artificial, you could mentally replace `int` by a _very large dynamically allocated integer_ which is inherently non _thread-safe_ and for which multiplications are extremely costly.]

The _member-function_ `area` is no longer _thread-safe_, it is doing writes now and is not internally synchronized. Is it a problem? The call to `area` may happen as part of a _copy-constructor_ of another object, such _constructor_ could have been called by some operation on a _standard container_ from a different thread, and at that point the _standard library_ expects this operation to behave as a _read_ in regard to _data races_. But we are doing writes!

As soon as we put a `rect` in a _standard container_ &mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash; we are entering a _contract_ with the _Standard Library_. To keep doing writes in a `const` function while still honoring that contract, we need to internally synchronize those writes:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class rect {
        int width = 0, height = 0;

        mutable std::mutex cache_mutex;
        mutable int cached_area = 0;
        mutable bool cached_area_valid = true;

    public:
        /*...*/
        void set_size( int new_width, int new_height ) {
            if( new_width != width || new_height != height )
            {
                std::lock_guard< std::mutex > guard( cache_mutex );
            
                cached_area_valid = false;
            }
            width = new_width;
            height = new_height;
        }
        int area() const {
            std::lock_guard< std::mutex > guard( cache_mutex );
            
            if( !cached_area_valid ) {
                cached_area = width;
                cached_area *= height;
                cached_area_valid = true;
            }
            return cached_area;
        }
    };

Note that we made the `area` function _thread-safe_, but the `set_size` function is &mdash;deliberately&mdash; _non thread-safe_ so the `rect` still isn't _thread-safe_. A call to `area` happening at the same time that a call to `set_size` may still end up computing the wrong value, since the assignments to `width` and `height` are not protected by the mutex.

If we really wanted a _thread-safe_ `rect`, we would use a synchronization primitive to protect the _non thread-safe_ `rect`.

# Summary

_Const-correctness_ is a good thing. It lets us express an intent directly with language constructs, and we get some help from the compiler to enforce it.

- `const` means _logically immutable_. Implement your `const` methods so that this expectation holds.
- `const` means _thread-safe_ (not necessarily _synchronized_).  Implement your `const` methods so that this expectation holds.
- `mutable` members can always be changed, even inside `const` functions.
- `const_cast`s that remove _constness_ are only ok if the object was originally declared _non-`const`_.
