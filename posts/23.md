One year down the road, 2015 has gone by but not without modifications to the _**C++** lands_. Several _Technical Specification (TS)_ documents were published, and heavy work continues to go into both existing and new ones. Meanwhile, work is underway for what it is intended to be **C++17**...

<!-- pagebreak -->

# What Changed

Four new _Technical Specification (TS)_ documents were published: The [Transactional Memory TS](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-19/interlude#transactional-memory "Transactional Memory - Interlude 2014 - Tales of C++"), the [Parallelism TS](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-19/interlude#parallelism "Parallelism - Interlude 2014 - Tales of C++"), the [Library Fundamentals TS (v1)](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-19/interlude#library-fundamentals "Library Fundamentals - Interlude 2014 - Tales of C++"), and the [Concepts TS](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-19/interlude#concepts "Concepts - Interlude 2014 - Tales of C++"). Work on the [Concurrency TS](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-19/interlude#concurrency "Concurrency - Interlude 2014 - Tales of C++") was finished, and it was approved for publication. Meanwhile, work on the [Library Fundamentals TS v2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4562.html "Working Draft, C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals, Version 2") continues, and new work items were created for a Parallelism TS v2 as well as for a [Ranges TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0021r0.pdf "Working Draft, C++ Extensions for Ranges") &mdash;based on Eric Niebler's work on ranges&mdash; and a [Networking TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0112r1.html "Networking Library (Revision 7)") &mdash;based on Chris Kohlhoff's _ASIO_&mdash;.

![Writing good C++14, Bjarne Stroustrup - CppCon 2015](/content/public/upload/34233a2a5740969141e8533a49b4527f8539b7d1_o.jpg)
<div align="center" markdown="1">[Writing good C++14, Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OEu9C51K2A "CppCon 2015: Bjarne Stroustrup, Writing Good C++14 - YouTube") - [CppCon 2015](http://cppcon.org "cppcon | The C++ Conference")</div>

The standardization committee gained a new Study Group. During CppCon 2014, there was a large number of game developers interested in ISO **C++**, and in contributing to the standardization process. The topics of interest to this group also happen to overlap with that of developers interested in low-latency computing outside game development, like finance and embedded. From that interest, a Study Group on Game Development and Low-Latency Computing (SG14) was born. The first meeting of this group was held in September at CppCon 2015, and the next one will take place in March at GDC 2016.

Finally, due to changes in ISO document procedures, a new numbering scheme has been introduced for naming documents. Proposals and position papers will follow the new `PnnnnRm` scheme, where `nnnn` is the four-digit stable proposal number, and `m` is the revision number. Administrative papers &mdash;working drafts, agendas, minutes&mdash; will continue to be ISO `N`-numbered documents.

# C++17

Work continued into what will be the next standard, targeting 2017. The following features have been accepted into the working draft, but might be altered or even removed before the next standard is published &mdash;these changes are the ones that took place during 2015, previous changes were detailed in last year's post and can be found [here](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-19/interlude#c17 "Interlude, C++17 - Tales of C++")&mdash;.

## What's new - Language Features

### `__has_include`

[**P0061**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0061r1.html "__has_include for C++17") proposes to standardize the preprocessor feature `__has_include`, introduced in the feature-testing recommendations standing document &mdash;[SD-6](http://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-6-sg10-feature-test-recommendations "SD-6: SG10 Feature Test Recommendations - Standard C++")&mdash;. The has-include-expression searches for its argument as if it were used in an `#include` directive, evaluating to `1` if the search for the source file succeeds, and to `0` if the search fails.

The following example demonstrates a way to include a library `optional` facility only if it is available:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    #if __has_include(<optional>)
    # include <optional>
    # define have_optional 1
    #elif __has_include(<experimental/optional>)
    # include <experimental/optional>
    # define have_optional 1
    # define experimental_optional 1
    #else
    # define have_optional 0
    #endif

### Core Improvements

[**P0012**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0012r1.html "Make exception specifications be part of the type system, version 5") proposes to make exception specifications part of the type system, making the following example ill-formed:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    void p() {};
    void (*pp)() noexcept = &p;  // error: cannot convert to pointer to noexcept function

[**P0136**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0136r1.html "Rewording inheriting constructors (core issue 1941 et al)") proposes to change the way in which inheriting constructors are implemented. A _using-declaration_ that names a constructor now intuitively makes the corresponding base class constructors visible to initializations of the derived class, rather than declaring additional derived class constructors to forward the calls.

### Core Cleanup

[**P0001**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0001r1.html "Remove Deprecated Use of the register Keyword") proposes to remove the use of the `register` _storage-class-specifier_; the keyword is still reserved and might be repurposed in the future. Any surviving use of the specifier can simply be removed to retain the original meaning.

[**P0002**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0002r1.html "Remove Deprecated operator++(bool)") proposes to remove the somewhat surprising increment operator for `bool`, deprecated since its introduction in **C++98**.

[**P0134**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0134r0.html "Introducing a name for brace-or-equal-initializers for non-static data members") proposes to introduce the name _default member initializer_ for brace-or-equal-initializers for non-static data members, and it consists of editorial changes only.

## What's new - Standard Library Features

### Logical Type Traits

[**P0013**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0013r1.html "Logical Operator Type Traits (revison 1)") proposes three new type traits for performing logical operations with other traits, `conjunction`, `disjunction`, and `negation`, corresponding to the operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` respectively.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    // Accepts one or more arguments of the same type.
    template <typename T, typename... Ts>
    std::enable_if_t<std::conjunction<std::is_same<T, Ts>...>::value>
    foo(T, Ts...) {}

    // Accepts zero or more arguments of type int.
    template<typename... Ts>
    std::enable_if_t<std::conjunction<std::is_same<int, Ts>...>::value>
    bar(Ts...) {}

### Constant View

[**P0007**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0007r1.html "Constant View: A proposal for a std::as_const helper function template") proposes a helper function template `as_const`, which simply takes a reference and returns it as a reference to `const`.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename T> std::add_const_t<T>& as_const(T& t) { return t }
    template <typename T> void as_const(T const&&) = delete;

### `bool_constant`

[**N4389**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4389.html "Wording for bool_constant, revision 1") proposes an alias template for [`std::integral_constant`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integral_constant "std::integral_constant - cppreference.com")s of `bool` type:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <bool B>
    using bool_constant = integral_constant<bool, B>;

### `shared_mutex`

 Before **C++14** shipped, [**N3891**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3891.htm "N3891: A proposal to rename shared_mutex to shared_timed_mutex") proposed to rename `std::shared_mutex` to [`std::shared_timed_mutex`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_timed_mutex "std::shared_time_mutex - cppreference.com"), as it satisfies the _TimedMutex_ concept, leaving room for an untimed `shared_mutex` that only satisfied the basic _Mutex_ concept. [**N4508**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4508.html "A proposal to add shared_mutex (untimed) (Revision 4)") fills that gap by proposing an untimed `shared_mutex`.

### Library Improvements

[**N4387**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4387.html "Improving pair and tuple, revision 3") proposes to improve certain `pair` and `tuple` constructors by making them conditionally `explicit`, depending on whether any of the selected constructors for the elements are themselves `explicit`. This change permits the use of _list initialization_  without opening a hole in the type system:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    std::tuple<int, int> pixel_coordinates() {
      return {10, -15};
    }

A conditionally `explicit` constructor is editorially represented as _EXPLICIT_ in the standard. An implementation will have to provide two &mdash;almost identical&mdash; mutually exclusively constrained constructors:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename T>
    struct A {
      template <typename U, typename std::enable_if<
          std::is_constructible<T, U>::value
       && std::is_convertible<U, T>::value, bool>::type = false>
      A(U&& u) : t(std::forward<U>(u)) {}

      template <typename U, typename std::enable_if<
          std::is_constructible<T, U>::value
       && !std::is_convertible<U, T>::value, bool>::type = false>
      explicit A(U&& u) : t(std::forward<U>(u)) {}

      T t;
    };

[**N4510**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4510.html "Minimal incomplete type support for standard containers, revision 4") proposes to add support for incomplete types in [`std::vector`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector "std::vector - cppreference.com"), [`std::list`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list "std::list - cppreference.com"), and [`std::forward_list`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/forward_list "std::forward_list - cppreference.com"), allowing their use in recursive data structure definitions:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    struct entry {
      std::list<entry> messages;
      /*...*/
    };

The scope of the proposal is limited to those containers for which the use of incomplete type is already supported by current implementations. Future proposals are expected to explore relaxing the remaining &mdash;allocating&mdash; containers.

[**N3932**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3932.htm "Variable Templates For Type Traits (Revision 1)") proposed to add to the Library Fundamentals TS variable templates with a `_v` suffix as a less verbose synonym for type traits that yield a `::value`. [**P0006**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0006r0.html "Adopt Type Traits Variable Templates from Library Fundamentals TS for C++17 ") proposes to merge those into the working draft for **C++17**.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    static_assert(!std::is_same_v<short, int>);

[**P0092**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0092r1.html "Polishing &lt;chrono&gt;") proposes to add rounding operations for `duration`s and `time_point`s, as well as an `abs` overload for signed `duration` types.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    using namespace std::chrono;

    milliseconds ms(2500);
    std::cout << floor<seconds>(ms).count() << "s\n"; // 2s
    std::cout << round<seconds>(ms).count() << "s\n"; // 2s
    std::cout << ceil<seconds>(ms).count() << "s\n"; // 3s

[**P0156**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0156r0.html "Variadic lock_guard (Rev. 3)") proposes to extend [`std::lock_guard`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock_guard "std::lock_guard - cppreference.com") to support multiple locks.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    void swap(MyType& l, MyType& r) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex, std::mutex> lck(l.mtx, r.mtx);
        /* ... */
    }

[**P0074**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0074r0.html "Making std::owner_less more flexible") proposes to make [`std::owner_less`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/owner_less "std::owner_less - cppreference.com") more flexible by introducing an `std::owner_less<void>` specialization &mdash;following **C++14**'s transparent operators&mdash;, capable of handling comparisons of smart pointers of different types, and without introducing any temporaries.

### Library Cleanup

[**P0004**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0004r1.html "Remove Deprecated iostreams aliases") proposes to remove old iostreams members, which used to alias other types or member functions for compatibility reasons, deprecated since their introduction in **C++98**.

# TS

A lot of work is going on in the form of _Technical Specifications (TS)_. Each TS would deserve and entire post &mdash;or several&mdash; in order to do justice to them; what follows is merely a glance at what they have to offer.

## Library Fundamentals v2

[**N4388**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4388.html "A Proposal to Add a Const-Propagating Wrapper to the Standard") proposes to add a `propagate_const` wrapper class that propagates `const`-ness to pointer-like member objects. Within a `const` member function, all &mdash;non-`mutable`&mdash; member objects are seen as `const` too, but `const`-ness is shallow; for pointer and pointer-like members, this means the pointers themselves are `const` while the thing they point to remains unaffected:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    struct A {
      void foo() { std::cout << "non-const" << std::endl; }
      void foo() const { std::cout << "const" << std::endl; }
    };

    struct B {
      std::unique_ptr<A> _that_a = std::make_unique<A>();

      void bar() { _that_a->foo(); } // prints "non-const"
      void bar() const { _that_a->foo(); } // prints "non-const" too
    };

This might be undesirable on occasion, and even surprising to some. The `propagate_const` wrapper class is introduced to automatically address this situation, without having to `const_cast` every access to a pointer or pointer-like member:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    struct C {
      std::experimental::propagate_const<
          std::unique_ptr<A>> _that_a = std::make_unique<A>();

      void bar() { _that_a->foo(); } // prints "non-const"
      void bar() const { _that_a->foo(); } // prints "const"
    };

[**N4502**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4502.pdf "Proposing Standard Library Support for the C++ Detection Idiom, v2") proposes to add a detection toolkit for type introspection. It identifies a common pattern for type introspection &mdash;popularized by [`void_t`](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3911.pdf "TransformationTrait Alias void_t")&mdash;, which it calls the _detection idiom_:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    // primary template handles types that have no nested `type` member
    template <typename, typename = void>
    struct has_type_member
      : std::false_type {};

    // specialization recognizes types that do have a nested `type` member
    template <typename T>
    struct has_type_member<T, std::void_t<typename T::type>>
      : std::true_type {};

This idiom is encapsulated in a self-contained metafunction that is parameterized on an archetypal expression:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    // has_type_member revisited
    template <typename T> using type_member_t =
        typename T::type;

    template <typename T> using has_type_member =
        std::experimental::is_detected<T, type_member_t>;

    // ...and more
    template <typename T> using copy_assign_t =
        decltype(std::declval<T&>() = std::declval<T const &>());

    template <typename T> using is_copy_assignable =
        std::experimental::is_detected<T, copy_assign_t>;

[**N4519**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4519.pdf "Source-Code Information Capture") proposes to add a feature to allow a function to capture information about the source code calling it. This is the first of the reflection proposals to materialize, and it intends to replace use of macros such as `__FILE__`, `__LINE__` and `__func__`.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    void log_debug(std::string const& message,
        std::experimental::source_location loc =
            std::experimental::source_location::current()) {
      std::clog << loc.file_name()
          << ":" << loc.line_number()
          << ":" << loc.column()
          << ":" << loc.function_name()
          << ":" << message << std::endl;
    }

[**N4391**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4391.html "make_array, revision 4") proposes to add a `make_array` creation function to deduce both element type and array bound in an `std::array`, as well as an additional `to_array` function that creates an `std::array` from a core language one.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    auto arr = std::experimental::make_array(0, 1, 2);  // std::array<int, 3>
    auto str = std::experimental::to_array("012");  // std::array<char, 4>

[**N4531**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4531.html "std::rand replacement, revision 3") proposes a direct replacement to the deprecated `std::rand` &mdash;dubbed "baby's first rand"&mdash;, with a per-thread uniform random number generator.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    std::experimental::randint(0, 6);  // randomly seeded
    std::experimental::reseed(0);  // for debugging purpose
    std::experimental::shuffle(begin(v), end(v));
    std::experimental::reseed();  // back to random

## Parallelism v2

A second version of the [Parallelism TS](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-19/interlude#parallelism "Parallelism - Interlude 2014 - Tales of C++") was started. It builds on the first by adding _task blocks_ as proposed by [**P0155**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0155r0.pdf "Task Block R5"), with the goal of writing expressive and portable fork-join parallel code:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename F>
    int traverse(node* n, F compute) {
      int left = 0, right = 0;

      std::experimental::parallel::define_task_block(
        [&](std::experimental::parallel::task_block& tb) {
          if (n->left)
            tb.run([&] { left = traverse(n->left, compute); });
          if (n->right)
            tb.run([&] { right = traverse(n->right, compute); });
        });

      return compute(n) + left + right;
    }

Each call to `run` spawns a _task_, a unit of work that is allowed to execute in parallel with respect to the caller. The `define_task_block` function delineates a region in the program containing all those tasks spawned, which are all joined back to a single thread on return from `define_task_block`.

## Ranges

A new work item was created for the [Ranges TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0021r0.pdf "Working Draft, C++ Extensions for Ranges"). In this first step, foundational and iterator concepts are reformulated using the syntax of the Concept TS, and algorithms are respecified in terms of these new concepts. Additionally, new algorithm overloads are added that take iterable objects, rather than pairs of iterators. Furthermore, constraints are relaxed to permit the use of _sentinels_ to denote the end of a range.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    int main() {
      using namespace std::experimental::ranges;

      auto v = std::vector<std::string>{"this", "is", "a", "test"};
      auto out = ostream_iterator<std::string>{std::cout, " "};
      sort(v);
      copy(v, out);
      std::cout << '\n';
      auto result = reverse_copy(v, out);
      std::cout << '\n';
      return !(result.in() == end(v));
    }

This paper does not specify any new range views, actions, facades, or adaptor utilities yet.

## Networking

A new work item was created for the [Networking TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0112r1.html "Networking Library (Revision 7)"). It brings sockets programming &mdash;as seen in [_Boost.ASIO_](http://www.boost.org/doc/html/boost_asio.html "Boost.Asio")&mdash;to the standard library:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    using namespace std::experimental::net;

    // echoes the characters it receives back to the client in upper case, synchronous
    void sync_connection(ip::tcp::socket& socket) {
      try {
        std::vector<char> buffer_space(1024);
        for (;;) {
          std::size_t length = socket.read_some(buffer(buffer_space));
          uppercase(buffer_space.begin(), buffer_space.begin() + length);
          write(socket, buffer(buffer_space, length));
        }
      } catch (std::system_error& e) { /* ...*/ }
    }

## That's it?

This is by no means an exhaustive list! Furthermore, there's plenty of work in the pipeline &mdash;not yet approved into a working draft&mdash;, targeting the standard itself or one of the several TSes.

- The modules study group has reached consensus on the design for a first phase, and is expected to provide formal wording for what will soon become a Modules TS.

- The controversial `variant` has reached design agreement. Going forward, it will look a lot like the Lenexa compromise one, but access to an invalid variant will throw an exception rather than triggering undefined behavior.

- The coroutines proposal made progress and it is working on formal wording for **C++17** &mdash;some members of the committee think that [they belong in a TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0158r0.html "Coroutines belong in a TS") instead&mdash;.

- The contracts initiative gains momentum, as proponents of different proposals have agreed in the core details.

- ...and [much, much more](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/ "ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21 - Papers 2015").

During 2015, the _**C++** lands_ grew bigger at an outstanding rate! As the _TS_ model &mdash;which allows to decouple and publish work independently from the standard&mdash; is proving to be a success, 2016 it's certainly looking to be a good year for **C++**...
