**C++** provides [`std::bind`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/bind "std::bind - cppreference.com") for partial function application, which is the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of same or smaller arity. In the _**C++** lands_, `std::bind` returns a function object which stores copies of the fixed arguments &mdash;known as _bound arguments_&mdash;, allowing the resulting _bind expression_ to be called at points far from where it was created, multiple times if desired. This has important implications when the intention is to make that call just once...

# The Problem

The function object returned from [`std::bind`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/bind "std::bind - cppreference.com") is not prepared to deal with the notion that sometimes it's going to be called just once &mdash;if at all&mdash;, and then immediately thrown away. In those scenarios, it would be better to relinquish ownership of the bound arguments to the wrapped function object, avoiding an unnecessary copy that would not even be possible when handling arguments of _movable-only_ types.

These _deferred calls_ appear in the standard at several places &mdash;[`std::call_once`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/call_once "std::call_once - cppreference.com"), [`std::thread`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/thread "std::thread::thread - cppreference.com"), [`std::async`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/async "std::async - cppreference.com")&mdash;. Just like with `std::bind`, the target callable and arguments are _decay copied_, as the call will happen at a point in time where the lifetime of those objects could have already ended. Unlike `std::bind`, both wrapped callable and arguments will be moved &mdash;turned into _rvalues_&mdash; when the call is eventually made.

The standard library already provides the first half of the solution to the implementation of these _deferred calls_, or the more general _one shot_ `bind`. The remaining half is moving the wrapped callable and arguments out of bind, which requires knowing which of the arguments are bound and which ones aren't.

## `std::bind`

Since the solution will be reusing `std::bind`, it's important to know the rules under which it operates:

> **[20.9.9/1]** The function template `bind` returns an object that binds a callable object passed as an argument to additional arguments.
>
> **[20.9.9.1/3]** In the text that follows, the following names have the following meanings:
>
> - `FD` is the type `decay<F>::type`,
>
> - `fd` is an lvalue of type `FD` constructed from `std::forward<F>(f)`,
>
> - `Ti` is the _ith_ type in the template parameter back `BoundArgs`,
>
> - `TiD` is the type `decay<Ti>::type`,
>
> - `ti` is the _ith_ argument in the function parameter pack `bound_args`,
>
> - `tid` is an lvalue of type `TiD` constructed from `std::forward<Ti>(ti)`,
>
> - `Uj` is the _jth_ deduced type of the `UnBoundArgs&&...` parameter of the forwarding call wrapper, and
>
> - `uj` is the _jth_ argument associated with `Uj`.
>
> `template<class F, class... BoundArgs>`  
> _unspecified_ `bind(F&& f, BoundArgs&&... bound_args);`
>
> **[20.9.9.1/3]** _Returns:_ A forwarding call wrapper `g` with a weak result type (20.9.2). The effect of `g(u1, u2, ..., uM)` shall be `INVOKE (fd, std::forward<V1>(v1), std::forward<V2>(v2), ..., std::forward<VN>(vN), result_of<FD cv & (V1, V2, ..., VN)>::type)`, where _cv_ represents the _cv_-qualifiers of `g` and the values and types of the bound arguments `v1, v2, ..., vN` are determined as specified below. _[...]_
> 
> **[20.9.9.1/10]** The values of the _bound arguments_ `v1, v2, ..., vN` and their corresponding types `V1, V2, ..., VN` depend on the types `TiD` derived from the call to `bind` and the _cv_-qualifiers _cv_ of the call wrapper `g` as follows:
> 
> - if `TiD` is `reference_wrapper<T>`, the argument is `tid.get()` and its type `Vi` is `T&`;
> 
> - if the value of `is_bind_expression<TiD>::value` is `true`, the argument is `tid(std::forward<Uj>(uj)...)` and its type `Vi` is `result_of<TiD cv & (Uj&&...)>::type&&`;
> 
> - if the value `j` of `is_placeholder<TiD>::value` is not zero, the argument is `std::forward<Uj>(uj)` and its type `Vi` is `Uj&&`;
> 
> - otherwise, the value is `tid` and its type `Vi` is `TiD` _cv_ `&`.

In short, the resulting function object from `std::bind` will pass lvalue references to the bound arguments, implicitly unwrapping [`std::reference_wrapper`s](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/reference_wrapper "std::reference_wrapper - cppreference.com"), evaluating nested _bind expressions_, and perfectly forwarding unbound arguments where placeholders were used.

# The Solution

## `one_shot_bind`

The forwarding call wrapper returned from `std::bind` is half of the solution. The other half consist of another forwarding call wrapper, one with knowledge of how the _bind expression_ was created:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace detail {
      template <typename F, typename BoundArgs, typename FD = std::decay_t<F>>
      class one_shot_wrapper;

      template <typename F, typename ...BoundArgs, typename FD>
      class one_shot_wrapper<F, void(BoundArgs...), FD>
      {
      public:
        explicit one_shot_wrapper(FD const& f)
         : _f{f}
        {}
        explicit one_shot_wrapper(FD&& f)
         : _f{std::move(f)}
        {}

        template <typename ...Args>
        decltype(auto) operator()(Args&&... args)
        {
          return INVOKE(std::move(_f)
          , forward_from_bound<BoundArgs>::call(std::forward<Args>(args))...);
        }

      private:
        FD _f;
      };

The `one_shot_wrapper` is a forwarding call wrapper providing an `operator()` that forwards or moves each argument as appropriate. Such `operator` is non-`const`, so that attempts to call a `const` qualified instance of the wrapper returned from `std::bind` will result in a compilation error. The missing piece of the solution is the most important one: `forward_from_bound`, where the decisions are actually made.

The base case deals with ordinary bound arguments. Those are received by non-`const` lvalue reference and moved out:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace detail {
      template <
        typename Ti, typename TiD = std::decay_t<Ti>
      , typename Enable = void
      >
      struct forward_from_bound {
        static TiD&& call(TiD& tid) {
          return std::move(tid);
        }
      };
    }

Then there's the placeholders, for which unbound arguments are received; and the bind expressions, for which the result of evaluating said expressions are received. Those are perfectly forwarded:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace detail {
      template <typename Ti, typename TiD>
      struct forward_from_bound<
        Ti, TiD
      , typename std::enable_if<
          std::is_placeholder<TiD>::value ||
          std::is_bind_expression<TiD>::value
        >::type
      > {
        template <typename Uj>
        static Uj&& call(Uj&& uj) {
          return std::forward<Uj>(uj);
        }
      };
    }

Finally, the bound reference wrappers, which are received unwrapped and returned the same:
 
    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace detail {
      template <typename Ti, typename T>
      struct forward_from_bound<
        Ti, std::reference_wrapper<T>
      > {
        static T& call(T& tid) {
          return tid;
        }
      };
    }

With those pieces ready, it is now possible to reuse `std::bind` and complete the solution:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename F, typename ...BoundArgs>
    auto one_shot_bind(F&& f, BoundArgs&&... bound_args) {
      return std::bind(
        detail::one_shot_wrapper<F, void(BoundArgs...)>{std::forward<F>(f)}
      , std::forward<BoundArgs>(bound_args)...);
    }

### A note on move semantics

Moving the bound arguments out of the call wrapper is fine, because the contract of `one_shot_bind` requires that the resulting function object be invoked _at most_ once. It's easy to see how an additional flag could be added &mdash;in debug builds only&mdash; so that breaking that contract results in a runtime assertion.

However, there's another problematic scenario &mdash;one with `std::bind` itself&mdash; from which protecting the user is impossible in the general case. Consider the following snippet:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    void foo(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
      // do something with s1 and s2 that
      // justifies taking them by value...
    }
    
    int main() {
      using namespace std::placeholders;
      auto bound = std::bind(&foo, _1, _1);
      bound(std::string{"Hello"});
    }

Here `foo` takes both arguments by value, both of which are initialized from perfectly forwarding the `std::string{"Hello"}` temporary. Only one of them will contain the string `"Hello"`, which one of them is implementation defined.

## `deferred_call`

With the general solution in place, it's time to look at implementing the simpler use of deferred calls found in the standard. The differences with `one_shot_bind` are simple: all arguments are provided at the bind point, and none of them is special. Actually, the lack of implicit unwrapping of `std::reference_wrapper`s is an inconsistency with the rest of the standard library &mdash;and an inconvenient one when used in contexts where implicit conversions does not happen&mdash; so this solution will differ from the standard to fill that need.

Not only placeholders and bind expressions from the standard library are handled specially by `std::bind`, but all objects whose type conforms to the corresponding traits &mdash;[`std::is_placeholder`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/is_placeholder "std::is_placeholder - cppreference.com"), [`std::is_bind_expression`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/is_bind_expression "std::is_bind_expression - cppreference.com")&mdash;. In order to avoid special treatment for those arguments, their types have to be hidden; this can be done using yet another wrapper:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace detail {
      template <typename T, typename TD = std::decay_t<T>>
      class protect_wrapper
      {
      public:
        explicit protect_wrapper(TD const& value)
         : _value{value}
        {}
        explicit protect_wrapper(TD&& value)
         : _value{std::move(value)}
        {}

        TD& get() {
          return _value;
        }

      private:
        TD _value;
      };

      // hide the type of placeholders and bind expressions
      template <
        typename T, typename TD = std::decay_t<T>
      , typename Enable =
          typename std::enable_if<
            std::is_placeholder<TD>::value ||
            std::is_bind_expression<TD>::value
          >::type
      >
      protect_wrapper<T> protect(T&& value)
      {
          return protect_wrapper<T>{std::forward(value)};
      }

      // leave everything else as is
      template <
        typename T, typename TD = std::decay_t<T>
      , typename Enable =
          typename std::enable_if<
            !std::is_placeholder<TD>::value &&
            !std::is_bind_expression<TD>::value
          >::type
      >
      T&& protect(T&& value)
      {
          return value;
      }
    }

This wrapper has to be automatically unwrapped by `one_shot_bind`, and its value moved out:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace detail {
      template <typename Ti, typename T>
      struct forward_from_bound<
        Ti, protect_wrapper<T>
      > {
        static T&& call(protect_wrapper<T>& tid) {
          return std::move(tid.get());
        }
      };
    }

The implementation of `deferred_call` looks just like the one of `one_shot_bind`, except that all special arguments are protected:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename F, typename ...Args>
    auto deferred_call(F&& f, Args&&... args) {
      return std::bind(
        detail::one_shot_wrapper<F, void(Args...)>{std::forward<F>(f)}
      , detail::protect(std::forward<Args>(args))...);
    }

### The Lambda Predicament

This seems like a lot of work for something repeatedly described in the standard library &mdash;and that's without considering that the implementation for [`INVOKE`](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3727.html "A proposal to add invoke function template") has to be provided as well&mdash;. Maybe a _lambda expression_, supposedly more powerful than a _bind expression_, is a better choice for the simple case of `deferred_call`. Here is a limited example of how such **C++14** lambda would look:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename F, typename A0>
    auto deferred_call(F&& f, A0&& a0) {
      return [
        f = std::forward<F>(f)
      , arg0 = std::forward<A0>(a0)
      ]() mutable -> decltype(auto) {
        return INVOKE(std::move(f), std::move(a0));
      };
    }

Not only is this verbose, particularly the _decay copy_ of the captures, but it's also brittle. Without `mutable` &mdash;for which the empty parameter list is mandatory&mdash;, the generated `operator()` is `const`, in which case the captures would not be moved into the _INVOKE_ expression. Without `decltype(auto)`, the return type would drop the _cvref_-qualifications of the result type of the _INVOKE_ expression. But there is a bigger problem &mdash;which the lack of variadics in the previous snippet should have hint at&mdash;: an _init-capture_ is what allows to capture a _decay copy_ instead of a plain copy, but those cannot be used with parameter packs:

> **[5.1.2/24]**
> A _simple-capture_ followed by an ellipsis is a pack expansion (14.5.3). An _init-capture_ followed by an ellipsis is ill-formed.

A good workaround for such impediment is to _decay copy_ the arguments into a [`std::tuple`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple "std::tuple - cppreference.com"), and capture that instead. Conveniently, [`std::make_tuple`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/make_tuple "std::make_tuple - cppreference.com") will not only store _decayed copies_ of its arguments, but it will also implicitly unwrap `std::reference_wrapper`s. To expand the arguments when invoking the callable, [`apply`](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3829.pdf "apply() call a function with arguments from a tuple (V2)") could be used &mdash;another desired utility introduced yet not provided by the standard library&mdash;. The final implementation follows:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename F, typename ...Args>
    auto deferred_call(F&& f, Args&&... args) {
      return [
        f = std::forward<F>(f)
      , args = std::make_tuple(std::forward<Args>(args)...)
      ]() mutable -> decltype(auto) {
        return apply(std::move(f), std::move(args));
      };
    }

A lambda implementation is thus possible in **C++14** &mdash;assuming `apply` is given, just as `INVOKE` was assumed given before&mdash;, but hardly usable in the wild. Its complexity and fragility call for the solution to be put behind an abstraction layer, and its details soon forgotten...
