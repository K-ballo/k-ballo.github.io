One year down the road, 2013 has gone by but not without modifications to the _**C++** lands_. Two major compilers have reached **C++11** conformance &mdash;_GCC_ and _Clang_ &mdash;. Shortly after, the _Committee Draft (CD)_ for **C++14** was completed, which is now just around the corner...

<!-- pagebreak -->

# C++11

_GCC_ became **C++11** feature complete as of [v4.8.1](http://isocpp.org/blog/2013/05/gcc-4.8.1-released-c11-feature-complete "GCC 4.8.1 released, C++11 feature complete"), and it started including experimental support of **C++14** features &mdash;details [here](http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx1y.html "C++1y/C++14 Support in GCC")&mdash;.

_Clang_ reached full **C++11** conformance, language features and standard library features, as of [v3.3](http://isocpp.org/blog/2013/06/llvm-3.3-is-released "LLVM 3.3 is released!"), and it already is _draft_ **C++14** feature complete &mdash;details [here](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx14 "C++14, C++11 and C++98 Support in Clang")&mdash;.

_Visual C++_ is running somewhat behind, but not being **C++11** feature complete has not prevented it from supporting some of the upcoming **C++14** features &mdash;details [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/12/02/c-11-14-core-language-features-in-vs-2013-and-the-nov-2013-ctp.aspx "C++11/14 Core Language Features in VS 2013 and the Nov 2013 CTP")&mdash;.

All things considered, it was an impressive year for **C++** conformance. And notably, it looks like for the first time there will be feature complete compilers for a **C++** standard on the very same year it is ratified. The following slide from [_GoingNative_'s Keynote: Herb Sutter - One C++](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Keynote-Herb-Sutter-One-Cpp "Keynote: Herb Sutter - One C++") summarizes the situation nicely:

# C++14

The [_**C++14** Committee Draft_](http://isocpp.org/std/status "Recent milestones: C++14 CD, record attendance") was completed. Quoting from the announcement:

>  In August 2013, the primary comment international ballot (Committee Draft, aka “CD”) for C++14 was completed. Thanks to the high quality of the draft, the ballot results came in very clean: We received a total of 85 official comments (plus 30 unofficial late comments) from national bodies, which is far lower than than the over 500 comments received for each of the two comment ballots for C++0x/C++11.
> 
> At the September 2013 ballot resolution meeting, the committee generated final or tentative resolutions for all national body comments, and we expect all comment responses to be complete and applied at the upcoming February 2014 meeting, and for C++14 to enter its (potentially final) Draft International Standard (DIS) ballot following that meeting.

So what is new &mdash;tentatively, but highly unlikely to be removed at this point&mdash;?

## What's new - Language Features

### Lambda improvements

Lambdas as introduced in **C++11** were monomorphic, as there were concerns on how polymorphic lambdas would interact with _(heavyweight) concepts_ &mdash;which ended up not making the cut&mdash;. [**N3649**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3649.html "Generic (Polymorphic) Lambda Expressions (Revision 3)") proposes to allow specifying lambdas parameters as `auto`, which follows the type inference semantics of a good old templated parameter &mdash;not those of `auto`&mdash;. The result is an unnamed function object with a templated function operator:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    // 'Identity' is a lambda that accepts an argument of any type and
    // returns the value of its parameter.  
    auto Identity = [](auto a) { return a; };
    int three = Identity(3);
    char const* hello = Identity("hello");
    
    // Conversion to function pointer for capture-less lambdas
    int (*fpi)(int) = Identity;
    char (*fpc)(char) = Identity;

Another shortcoming of **C++11** lambdas was their inability to capture by move. Instead of introducing a new syntax for move capture, a generalized form of capture was proposed by [**N3648**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3648.html "Wording Changes for Generalized Lambda-capture"). This allows defining new names and/or values for the captures, consequentially allowing captures by move:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    // Capture by move
    auto ptr = std::make_unique<int>(10);
    auto lambda = [ptr = std::move(ptr)] {return *ptr;};

    // Synthesized captures
    int x = 4;
    auto y = [&r = x, x = x+1]()->int {
                r += 2;
                return x+2;
             }();  // Updates ::x to 6, and initializes y to 7.

### Type Inference

[**N3638**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3638.html "Return type deduction for normal functions") proposes to extend the return type deduction of lambdas to functions, while at the same time relaxing the requirements allowing complex statements and multiple `return`s:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    auto iterate(int len) // return type deduced int
    {
      for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        if (search (i))
          return i;
      return -1;
    }

Additionally, it proposes `decltype(auto)` as a way of requiring `decltype` type inference semantics on a declaration:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    int i;
    int&& f();
    auto           x3a = i;        // decltype(x3a) is int
    decltype(auto) x3d = i;        // decltype(x3d) is int
    auto           x4a = (i);      // decltype(x4a) is int
    decltype(auto) x4d = (i);      // decltype(x4d) is int&
    auto           x5a = f();      // decltype(x5a) is int
    decltype(auto) x5d = f();      // decltype(x5d) is int&&
    auto           x6a = { 1, 2 }; // decltype(x6a) is std::initializer_list<int>
    decltype(auto) x6d = { 1, 2 }; // error, { 1, 2 } is not an expression
    auto          *x7a = &i;       // decltype(x7a) is int*
    decltype(auto)*x7d = &i;       // error, declared type is not plain decltype(auto)

### Relaxed `constexpr` functions

A `constexpr` function in **C++11** follows tight requirements, simplifying implementation while retaining functionality &mdash;mainly by allowing recursive calls, at the expense of expressiveness&mdash;. [**N3652**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3652.html "Relaxing constraints on constexpr functions constexpr member functions and implicit const") proposes to lift several of those requirements:

 - Allow declarations within `constexpr` functions, other than:
   - `static` or `thread_local` variables,
   - uninitialized variables;
 - Allow `if` and `switch` statements (but not `goto`),
 - Allow all looping statements: `for` (including _range-based_ `for`), `while`, and `do`-`while`,
 - Allow mutation of objects whose lifetime began within the constant expression evaluation.

Additionally, it proposes to remove the rule that a `constexpr` non-static member function be implicitly `const` &mdash;which is a breaking change&mdash;:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    constexpr int abs(int x) {      // OK
      if (x < 0)
        x = -x;
      return x;
    }
    constexpr int prev(int x) {     // OK
      return --x;
    }
    constexpr int g(int x, int n) { // OK
      int r = 1;
      while (--n > 0) r *= x;
      return r;
    }

### Syntax sugar

[**N3472**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3472.pdf "Binary Literals in the C++ Core Language") proposes binary literals as in the existing _GCC_ extension &mdash;and is the same syntax as _Java 7_, _Python_, and _D_&mdash;: `0b1100`.

[**N3651**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3651.pdf "Variable Templates (Revision 1)") proposes the creation of `constexpr` variables that are templated, for parameterized constants:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename T>
    constexpr T pi = T(3.1415926535897932385);
    
    template <typename T>
    T area_of_circle_with_radius(T r) {
      return pi<T> * r * r;
    }

[**N3760**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3760.html "[[deprecated]] attribute") proposes the introduction of the `[[deprecated]]` attribute, providing a portable syntax to annotate entities whose use is discouraged.

[**N3781**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3781.pdf "Single-quotation-mark as a digit separator") proposes to use the single quotation mark `'` as a digit separator: `1'048'576`.

## What's new - Standard Library Features

### Compile-time integer sequences

[**N3658**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3658.html "Compile-time integer sequences") proposes to add a type _like_ `template<int...> struct index_sequence { };` so that an instantiation can be passed to a function template that deduces a parameter pack containing the integer sequence `0, 1, 2` &mdash;more precisely, it proposes `template<class T, T... I> struct integer_sequence`, and `index_sequence<size_t... I>` as a template alias for `integer_sequence<size_t, I...>`&mdash;. With such a type in the standard library toolbox, it is easy to implement a non-recursive expansion of `tuple` elements: 

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template<class F, class Tuple, std::size_t... I>
    decltype(auto) apply_impl(F&& f, Tuple&& t, index_sequence<I...>) {
      return std::forward<F>(f)(std::get<I>(std::forward<Tuple>(t))...);
    }
    
    template<class F, class Tuple>
    decltype(auto) apply(F&& f, Tuple&& t) {
      using Indices = make_index_sequence<std::tuple_size<std::decay_t<Tuple>>::value>;
      return apply_impl(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Tuple>(t), Indices());
    }

### Quoted Strings

[**N3654**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3654.html "Quoted Strings Library Proposal (Revision 2)") proposes to add the `quoted` stream I/O manipulator, which places delimiters &mdash;defaulted to double-quote `"`&mdash; around strings on output, and strips off the delimiters on input. This ensures strings with embedded white space round-trip as desired:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    std::stringstream ss;
    std::string original = "foolish me";
    std::string round_trip;

    ss << quoted(original);
    ss >> quoted(round_trip);

    std::cout << original;     // outputs: foolish me
    std::cout << round_trip;   // outputs: foolish me

    assert(original == round_trip); // assert will not fire

### `make_unique`

**C++11** provided `make_shared` for `shared_ptr`, but not `make_unique` for `unique_ptr`; this is widely viewed as an oversight. [**N3656**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3656.htm "make_unique (Revision 1)") proposes the adoption of `make_unique`, with which is now possible to say "never say `new`/`delete`" without caveats:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    auto ptr = std::make_unique<int>(10);

### Shared Locking in C++

[**N3659**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3659.html "Shared Locking in C++ (Revision 2)") proposes to add functionality to allow clients to easily code the well-known multiple-readers/single-writer locking pattern:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    std::shared_mutex mut;
    
    void example_reader()
    {
      std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> _(mut);
      / mut is now shared-locked
      // ...
    }   // mut is now unlocked
    
    void example_writer()
    {
      std::scoped_lock<std::shared_mutex> _(mut);
      // mut is now unique-locked
      // ...
    }   // mut is now unlocked

This proposal was originally part of the _Multithreading API for C++0X_ proposal, which was excluded to limit the scope of _C++0X_ in hopes of shipping a new standard by 2009.

### `std::result_of` and SFINAE

Computing the result type of an expression can easily be done with `std::result_of`, as opposed to writing a longer type computation involving `decltype` and `std::declval`. However, **C++11** requires the resulting _INVOKE_ expression within `result_of` to be well-formed, while using `decltype` directly does not cause a hard error. When used in function signatures, the direct use of `decltype` of an ill-formed call expression causes the function to be dropped due to _SFINAE_. [**N3462**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3462.html "std::result_of and SFINAE") proposes to condition the presence of the nested `result_of<>::type` typedef on whether the call expression is ill-formed or not, thus making it _SFINAE-friendly_:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    struct eat { template<typename T> eat(T const &) {} };
    struct not_incrementable {};
    
    struct inc {
      template<typename T>
      auto operator()(T t) const -> decltype(t++)
      { return t++; }
    };

    template<typename A>
    typename std::result_of<inc(A)>::type
    try_inc(A a) {
      return inc()(a);
    }
    
    not_incrementable try_inc(eat) {
      return not_incrementable();
    }
    
    int main() {
      int x = try_inc(1); // OK
      not_incrementable y = try_inc(std::string("foo")); // OK, not_incrementable
    }

### Making Operator Functors `greater<>`

[**N3421**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3421.htm "Making Operator Functors greater<>") proposes to make `<functional>`'s operator function objects easier to use and more generic. It does so by introducing the `greater<>` syntax &mdash;where the template argument defaults to `void`&mdash; resulting in a function object with a templated `operator()`, capable of accepting and perfectly forwarding arbitrary argument types and its result. This is referred to as _transparent_ operators:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), std::greater<ValueType>()); // C++11
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), std::greater<>()); // this proposal

### Adding heterogeneous comparison lookup to associative containers

The associative container lookup functions only take an argument of `key_type`, resulting in an implicit or explicit creation of a key object to do the lookup. [**N3657**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3657.htm "Adding heterogeneous comparison lookup to associative containers (rev 4)") proposes to allow searches using types which are comparable with the `key_type` in the cases where the comparison object is _transparent_ &mdash;`key_compare::is_transparent` exists&mdash;. The following variation constructs no temporary `std::string` objects:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    std::set<std::string, std::less<>> s = /* ... */;
    s.find("key");

### Addressing Tuples by Type

[**N3670**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3670.html "Wording for Addressing Tuples by Type: Revision 2") proposes to allow accessing `tuple` fields by type:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    std::tuple<std::string, std::string, int> t("foo", "bar", 7);
    int i = std::get<int>(t); // i == 7
    int j = std::get<2>(t); // Equivalent to the above: j == 7
    string s = std::get<std::string>(t); // Compile-time error. Ambiguous.

### User-defined Literals

The standard library is lacking predefined user-defined literals, even though the standard reserves names not starting with an underscore for it. [**N3642**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3642.pdf "User-defined Literals for Standard Library Types (part 1 - version 4)") proposes to add user-defined literal for `std::string `&mdash;`s`&mdash;, and several others for `chrono` durations &mdash;`h`, `min`, `s`, `ms`, `us`, `ns`&mdash;. [**N3660**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3660.pdf "User-defined Literals for std::complex part 2 of UDL for Standard Library Types (version 4)") complements it by proposing user-defined literals for `std::complex` &mdash;`i`, `il` and `if` for `std::complex<double>`, `std::complex<long double>` and `std::complex<float>` respectively&mdash;.

### TransformationTraits Redux

**C++11** introduced a number of _TransformationTraits_ &mdash;a class `template` that takes one template type argument and optional arguments that help define a transformation, and defines a nested type named `type` as a synonym for the transformed type&mdash;. [**N3655**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3655.pdf "TransformationTraits Redux, v2") proposes to add a set of template aliases for the _TransformationTraits_ present in the library in order to reduce the noise caused by the sorrounding `typename` and `::type`. Those template aliases take the number of the base _TransformationTrait_ with a `_t` prefix:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template<class T>
    using reference_t = std::conditional_t<std::is_reference<T>::value, T, std::add_lvalue_reference_t<T>>;

## That's it?

This is by no means an exhaustive list! The new standard also includes a number of defect fixes, improvements and minor clarifications. Furthermore, a considerable amount of work is heading for a separate _Technical Specification (TS)_, including those things that didn't make it in time for **C++14**:

 - **File System**, _Beman Dawes_: Work based on Boost.Filesystem v3, including file and directory iteration.

 - **Networking**, _Robert Pratte_: A small set of network-related libraries including support for network byte order transformation and URIs.

 - **Concepts Lite**, _Andrew Sutton_: Language extensions for template type checking.

 - **Library Fundamentals**, _Jeffrey Yasskin_: A set of standard library extensions for vocabulary types like `std::optional<>` and other fundamental utilities.

 - **Array Extensions**, _Lawrence Crowl_: Language and library extensions related to arrays, including runtime-sized arrays (aka arrays of runtime bound) and `std::dynarray<>`.

 - **Extensions for Concurrency**, _Artur Laksberg_: Initially includes library support for executors and non-blocking extensions to `std::future`. Additionally may include language extensions like await, and additional libraries such as concurrent hash containers and latches.

 - **Extensions for Parallelism**, _Jared Hoberock_: Initially includes a Parallel STL library with support for parallel algorithms to exploit multiple cores, and vectorizable algorithms to exploit CPU and other vector units.

The _**C++** lands_ grew bigger during 2013, and we can only expect this trend to intensify during 2014. With the likely ratification of **C++14** and at least some of the _TS_, it will certainly be a good year for **C++**...
