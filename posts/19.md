One year down the road, 2014 has gone by but not without modifications to the _**C++** lands_. **C++14** was completed, and _Clang_ has already reached full conformance! But it's not the end of the road, while the _Technical Specification (TS)_ documents continue to move forward, work has started on what it is intended to be **C++17**...

<!-- pagebreak -->

# C++14

Last time we [stopped and looked at the landscape](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-13/interlude "Interlude 2013 - Tales of C++"), **C++14** had completed its primary comment international ballot (Committee Draft, aka "CD"). After those comments where addressed, in February 2014 the Draft International Standard (aka "DIS") was started. The new draft included some minor changes, as well as several issue resolutions and editorial improvements.

![C++14: We’re done! (we think)](/content/public/upload/d63333d66ae65465c88832c80b571783847aebc8_o.jpg)
<div align="center" markdown="1">[Winter ISO C++ meeting](http://isocpp.org/blog/2014/02/trip-report "Trip report: Winter ISO C++ meeting - isocpp.org"), **C++14** is done!</div>

In August 2014, **C++14** completed its final international ballot.

_Clang_ reached full **C++14** conformance, language features and standard library features, as of v3.4, and it already implements some **C++17** features &mdash;details [here](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx14 "Clang - C++1z, C++14, C++11 and C++98 Status")&mdash;.

_GCC_ became **C++14** feature complete as of the not-yet-released v5, and standard library features are expected to follow soon &mdash;details [here](http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx1y.html "C++1y/C++14 Support in GCC")&mdash;.

_Visual C++_ continues to run behind, but it has picked up the pace to cover the conformance gap. The latest preview includes most **C++11** features, some **C++14** features, and even some features that may or may not turn to be **C++17** features &mdash;details [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/11/17/c-11-14-17-features-in-vs-2015-preview.aspx "C++11/14/17 Features In VS 2015 Preview")&mdash;.

## What changed

These changes are the ones that took place during 2014, previous changes were detailed in last year's post and can be found [here](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-13/interlude#c14 "Interlude, C++14 - Tales of C++").

### Adding `tuple_element_t`

The _TransformationTraits_ redux had already added to **C++14** template aliases for all transformation type traits in `<type_traits>`. [**N3887**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3887.pdf "Consistent Metafunction Aliases") applies the same guideline to the rest of the standard library, and adds the only missing template alias: `std::tuple_element_t`.

### A proposal to rename shared_mutex to shared_timed_mutex

The `std::shared_mutex` introduced in **C++14** satisfied the `TimedMutex` concept, as it provided timed blocking functionality. For consistency, and in order to leave room for a future mutex that only satisfied the basic `Mutex` concept, [**N3891**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3891.htm "A proposal to rename shared_mutex to shared_timed_mutex") renamed `std::shared_mutex` to [`std::shared_timed_mutex`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_timed_mutex "std::shared_timed_mutex - cppreference.com").

### Discouraging `rand`

The legacy **C** random number generation facility has been superseded by those introduced in **C++11**. Unlike [`rand`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/rand "std::rand - cppreference.com"), the new facilities specify the underlying algorithm used, and avoid any implicitly shared state such that they may be safely used in multi-threaded environments. A note in `rand` suggested to migrate to `<random>` instead. [**N3924**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3924.pdf "Discouraging rand() in C++14, v2") further discourages the use of `rand` by strengthening the existing note:

> **26.8 [c.math]/5**
> The `rand` function has the semantics specified in the C standard, except that the implementation may specify that particular library functions may call `rand`. It is implementation-defined whether the `rand` function may introduce data races (17.6.5.9). _[Note:_ The random number generation (26.5) facilities in this standard are often preferable to `rand`, because `rand`’s underlying algorithm is unspecified. Use of `rand` therefore continues to be nonportable, with unpredictable and oft-questionable quality and performance. _-end note]_

Additionally, it deprecates [`std::random_shuffle`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle "std::random_shuffle, std::shuffle - cppreference.com"). One of its overloads depends on `rand`, which is strongly discouraged; while the other one is cumbersome to use, and its behavior can be obtained in a simpler way by using [`std::shuffle`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle "std::random_shuffle, std::shuffle - cppreference.com").

# C++17

With **C++14** ready, work continued into what will be the next standard, targeting 2017. The following features have been accepted into the working draft, but might be altered or even removed before the next standard is published.

## What's new - Language Features

### Fold Expressions

[**N4295**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4295.html "Folding expressions") proposes a new kind of primary expression that allows parameter packs to be expanded as a sequence of operators. These fold expressions recursively apply a binary operator to the arguments in a parameter pack.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    // before
    auto verbose_and_sometimes_problematic_sum() {
      return 0;
    }

    template <typename T>
    auto verbose_and_sometimes_problematic_sum(T t) {
      return t;
    }

    template<typename T, typename... Ts>
    auto verbose_and_sometimes_problematic_sum(T t, Ts... ts) {
      return t + verbose_and_sometimes_problematic_sum(ts...);
    }

    // now
    template <typename... Ts>
    auto fold_expression_sum(Ts... ts) {
      return (ts + ...);
    }

This is in part motivated by the need of the upcoming _Concepts TS_ to declare constrained template parameter packs.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template<typename... Ts> requires (Integral<Ts> && ...)
    void foo(Ts...);

### Core Improvements

[**N3922**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3922.html "New Rules for auto deduction from braced-init-list") proposes to change the deduction rules for `auto`, which are somewhat special as they will attempt to deduce an `std::initializer_list<T>` type for a braced-init-list &mdash;which doesn't really have a type&mdash;. Under the new rules, an `std::initializer_list` will no longer be deduced when direct-initialization is employed, which shall have a single element.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    auto x1{ 0 }; // decltype(x1) is std::initializer_list<int> before, int now
    auto x2{ 1, 2 }; // decltype(x2) is std::initializer_list<int> before, error now: not a single initializer-clause
    auto x3 = { 0 }; // decltype(x3) is std::initializer_list<int>
    auto x4 = { 1, 2 }; // decltype(x4) is std::initializer_list<int>

[**N3928**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3928.pdf "Extending static_assert, v2") proposes to allow omitting the string literal for `static_assert`.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    static_assert(std::is_pod<X>::value, "oops!"); // ok
    static_assert(std::is_pod<X>::value); // error before, ok now

[**N4051**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4051.html "Allow typename in a template template parameter") proposes to allow the use of `typename` instead of `class` when declaring a template template parameter. Since the introduction of alias templates, template template arguments need not be class templates.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template<typename T> struct A {};
    template<typename T> using B = int;

    template<template<typename> class X> struct C; // ok
    C<A> ca; // ok
    C<B> cb; // ok, not a class template

    template<template<typename> typename X> struct D; // error before, ok now

[**N4230**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4230.html "Nested namespace definition (revision 2)") proposes to allow the use of a qualified name in a namespace definition.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace A { namespace B { namespace C { /*...*/ } } }
    namespace A::B::C { /*...*/ } // equivalent to above

[**N4259**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4259.pdf "Wording for std::uncaught_exceptions") proposes a replacement for [`std::uncaught_exception`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/uncaught_exception "std::uncaught_exception - cppreference.com"). It has [long been known](http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/047.htm "GotW #47: Uncaught Exceptions") that `std::uncaught_exception` is of little or no use; it simply flags whether there is an active exception in flight &mdash;one that hasn't yet been caught&mdash;, and thus whether stack unwinding is in progress _somewhere_ along the call stack. The newly introduced `std::uncaught_exceptions` returns the number of active exceptions instead, which is enough to make it useful; the old `std::uncaught_exception` is deprecated.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class scope_guard {
      int const uncaught_exceptions;
      /*...*/

    public:
      scope_guard(/*...*/)
        : uncaught_exceptions(std::uncaught_exceptions())/*, ...*/
      {}

      ~scope_guard() {
        if (std::uncaught_exceptions() == uncaught_exceptions) {
          std::cout << "died of natural causes";
        } else {
          std::cout << "killed by stack unwinding";
        }
      }
    };

[**N4266**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4266.html "Attributes for namespaces and enumerators") proposes to allow specifying attributes on enumerators and namespaces, and extends the `[[deprecated]]` attribute to apply to them.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    enum E {
      foobar = 0,
      foobat [[deprecated]] = foobar
    };

[**N4267**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4267.html "Adding u8 character literals"), proposes to add support for `u8` character literals. The set of characters representable with a single UTF-8 code unit is exactly that of ASCII, so these new literals &mdash;e.g., `u8'w'`&mdash; guarantee ASCII encoding, as well as improve consistency within the language.

[**N4268**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4268.html "Allow constant evaluation for all non-type template arguments") proposes to relax the restrictions on non-type template arguments for pointers, references, and pointers to members.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template<int *p> struct A {};
    int n;
    A<&n> a; // ok

    constexpr int *p() { return &n; }
    A<p()> b; // error before, ok now

### A note on Terse Range-Based For-Loops

A curious case is that of [**N3994**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3994.htm "Range-Based For-Loops: The Next Generation (Revision 1)"). It reckons that range-based for-loops are prone to be written as `for (auto elem : range)`, which it deems as "very bad" as it produces copies of each element. It proposes the terser syntax `for (elem : range)` as a novice friendly equivalent of `for (auto&& elem : range)`.

This feature was approved by the Evolution Working Group, but with the ballot underway it couldn't be voted into the working draft. When the time came for the full committee to vote on it, the feature was rejected. The concern was that this novel form of introducing names &mdash;that doesn't mention a type nor placeholder&mdash; proved to be surprising. It was furthermore noted that copying by default is inherent to **C++**'s nature, and has to be taught regardless.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    T *x = nullptr;
    for (x : values) { if (/*...*/) break; } // this introduces a new x!
    if (x) { /*...*/ } // outer x was never touched

This feature may return in the future in a different form.

### Core Cleanup

[**N4086**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4086.html "Removing trigraphs??!") proposes to remove &mdash;not deprecate&mdash; trigraphs from the language. It points out that trigraphs are not needed in the standard, since trigraph replacement can already be part of the implementation-defined mapping form physical source file characters to basic source characters.

[**N4262**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4262.pdf "Wording for Forwarding References") proposes to introduce the term _forwarding reference_ to refer to variables or parameters of type `T&&` where `T` is deduced. While these look like rvalue references, deduction rules dictate that `T` will be deduced as an lvalue reference when the argument is an lvalue, which due to reference collapsing results in an lvalue reference. Scott Meyers recognized this special case needed a special name, and so dubbed them [_universal references_](http://isocpp.org/blog/2012/11/universal-references-in-c11-scott-meyers "Universal References in C++11—Scott Meyers : Standard C++"). This name was considered misleading to "the committee", with _forwarding references_ being clearer as they were designed to support perfect forwarding.

[**N4285**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4285.html "Cleanup for exception-specification and throw-expression") proposes to adjust the wording for exceptions, and consists of &mdash;sizable&mdash; editorial changes only.

## What's new - Standard Library Features

### `void_t`

[**N3911**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3911.pdf "TransformationTrait Alias void_t") proposes to add `void_t` as a variadic template alias for `void`, which has proven useful in SFINAE contexts.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <typename T, typename = void>
    struct has_type_member : std::false_type {};

    template <typename T>
    struct has_type_member<T, void_t<typename T::type>> : std::true_type {};

    struct foo { using type = int; };
    static_assert(has_type_member<foo>::value);
    // typename T::type is well-formed, matches the specialization

    struct bar {};
    static_assert(!has_type_member<bar>::value);
    // typename T::type is not well-formed,
    // the specialization is not viable due to SFINAE, matches the base template
    
### `invoke`

[**N4169**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4169.html "A proposal to add invoke function template (Revision 1)") proposes to introduce the function template `std::invoke` for invoking any callable types, with the semantics of the pseudo-macro `INVOKE`.

### Non-member `size` and more

[**N4280**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4280.pdf "Non-member size() and more (Revison 2)") proposes to add non-member functions `size`, `empty` and `data`, akin to [`std::begin`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/begin "std::begin - cppreference.com")/[`std::end`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/end "std::end - cppreference.com").

### Library Improvements

[**N4089**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4089.pdf "Safe conversions in unique_ptr<T[]>, revision 2") proposes to allow conversions from `std::unique_ptr<T[]>` when they are known to be safe, like qualification-conversions.

[**N4277**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4277.html "TriviallyCopyable reference_wrapper (Revision 1)") proposes to make [`std::reference_wrapper<T>`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/reference_wrapper "std::reference_wrapper - cppreference.com") a trivially copyable type.

[**N4279**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4279.html "Improved insertion interface for unique-key maps (Revision 2.3)") proposes to add new interfaces for unique-key maps:

- `try_emplace` inserts an element into the map only if the key does not exist already; otherwise there is no effect &mdash;in particular, it does not modify its arguments&mdash;.
- `insert_or_assign` inserts the mapped element or assigns it to the current element if the key already exists; similar to `operator[]`, but does not require default-constructibility.

### Library Cleanup

[**N4190**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4190.htm "Removing auto_ptr, random_shuffle(), And Old <functional> Stuff") proposes to remove features that have been deprecated for years and superseded by modern features.

 - `std::unary_function`/`binary_function`: these helpers are unnecessary given **C++11**'s perfect forwarding, decltype, etc.
 - `std::ptr_fun`: function pointers no longer need to be wrapped.
 - `std::mem_fun`/`std::mem_fun_ref`: superseded by [`std::mem_fn`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/mem_fn "std::mem_fn - cppreference.com").
 - `std::bind1st`/`std::bind2nd`: superseded by [`std::bind`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/bind "std::bind - cppreference.com").
 - `std::auto_ptr`: superseded by [`std::unique_ptr`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr "std::unique_ptr - cppreference.com").
 - `std::random_shuffle`: prefer [`std::shuffle`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle "std::random_shuffle, std::shuffle - cppreference.com").

[**N4258**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4258.pdf "Cleaning up noexcept in the Library (Rev 3)") proposes to add or fix uses of `noexcept` in the library.

[**N4284**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4284.html "Contiguous Iterators") proposes to introduce the term _contiguous iterator_ as a refinement of random-access iterator, but does not introduce a corresponding `std::contiguous_iterator_tag` nor any new functionality.

# TS

A lot of work is going on in the form of _Technical Specifications (TS)_. Each TS would deserve and entire post &mdash;or several&mdash; in order to do justice to them; what follows is merely a glance at what they have to offer.

## Filesystem

The [Filesystem TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4099.html "Working Draft, Technical Specification &mdash; File System") &mdash;based on [Boost.Filesystem v3](http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm "Boost.Filesystem Library Version 3") was approved. It provides facilities to manipulate files and directories, and the paths that identify them.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace filesystem = std::experimental::filesystem;

    filesystem::path const& p = /*...*/;
    try {
      if (filesystem::exists(p)) {
        if (filesystem::is_regular_file(p)) {
          std::cout << p << " size is " << filesystem::file_size(p) << '\n';
        } else if (filesystem::is_directory(p)) {
          std::cout << p << " is a directory containing:\n";

          std::copy(filesystem::directory_iterator(p), filesystem::directory_iterator(),
            std::ostream_iterator<filesystem::directory_entry>(std::cout, "\n"));
        } else {
          std::cout << p << " exists, but is neither a regular file nor a directory\n";
        }
      } else {
        std::cout << p << " does not exist\n";
      }
    } catch (filesystem::filesystem_error const& ex) {
      std::cerr << ex.what() << '\n';
    }

## Library Fundamentals

The [Library Fundamentals TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4335.html "Working Draft, C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals") went through its first round of international ballot. It provides a bundle of general purpose facilities:

- [**N3793**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3793.html "A proposal to add a utility class to represent optional objects (Revision 5)") proposes `optional<T>` &mdash;based on [Boost.Optional](http://www.boost.org/libs/optional/doc/html/index.html "Boost.Optional")&mdash;, a type that may or may not store a value of type `T` in its storage space. Its interface allows to query if a value of type `T` is currently stored, and if so, to access it.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        template <typename T>
        std::experimental::optional<T> biggest(std::vector<T> const& vs) {
          std::experimental::optional<T> biggest; // initialized to nullopt
          for (T const& e : vs) {
            if (!biggest || *biggest < e) {
              biggest = e;
            }
          }
          return biggest;
        }

- [**N3804**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3804.html "Any Library Proposal (Revision 3)") proposes `any` &mdash;based on [Boost.Any](http://www.boost.org/libs/optional/doc/html/any.html "Boost.Any")&mdash;, a type-safe container for single values of value types.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        using many = std::list<std::experimental::any>;

        template <typename T>
        void append_any(many& values, T const& value) {
            values.push_back(value);
        }

        void append_nothing(many& values) {
            values.push_back(std::experimental::any());
        }

- [**N3866**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3866.html "Invocation type traits (Rev. 2)") proposes `invocation_type`, a new trait whose member typedef `type` is the implied function type of a callable object when called with the given argument types.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        struct C {
          int operator()(double d, int i);
          int operator()(double d1, double d2);
        };
        
        static_assert(std::is_same<
          std::experimental::invocation_type_t<C(int, int)>,
          int(double, int)>::value); // holds

- [**N3905**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3905.html "Extending std::search to use Additional Searching Algorithms (Version 4)") proposes an overload of `std::search` taking an additional _searcher object_, which can carry precomputed information or statistics about the pattern being searched for. A default searcher object is provided, as well as searcher objects for the "Boyer-Moore" and "Boyer-Moore-Horspool" algorithms.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        // existing code
        std::experimental::search(
          corpus_first, corpus_last, 
          pattern_first, pattern_last);

        // same code, new interface
        std::experimental::search(
          corpus_first, corpus_last, 
          std::experimental::make_default_searcher(pattern_first, pattern_last));

        // same code, different algorithm
        std::experimental::search(
          corpus_first, corpus_last, 
          std::experimental::make_boyer_moore_searcher(pattern_first, pattern_last));

- [**N3915**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3915.pdf "apply() call a function with arguments from a tuple (V3)") proposes `apply`, a facility that allows to call a function object with elements from a `tuple` as arguments. This functionality was previously included in the **C++14** standard as an example on the use of compile-time integer sequences.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        void foo(int bar, std::string baz){ /*...*/ }

        std::tuple<int, std::string> args = /*...*/;
        std::experimental::apply(foo, args);

- [**N3916**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3916.pdf "Polymorphic Memory Resources - r2") proposes facilities for decoupling an object's type from the allocator it uses to obtain memory. This is accomplished via the introduction of a `memory_resource` abstract class, which describes how blocks can be allocated and deallocated; the picture is completed with a `polymorphic_allocator<T>`, which wraps a pointer to a `memory_resource` in an _Allocator_ interface, and a `resource_adaptor<Allocator>`, which wraps an _Allocator_ in a `memory_resource` interface. Additionally, for each standard allocator-aware container, the `pmr` namespace provides an alias that uses a `polymorphic_allocator<T>`.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        void foo(std::experimental::pmr::vector<int> const&);

        std::experimental::pmr::vector<int> v1; // uses pmr::get_default_resource
        foo(v1);

        std::experimental::monotonic_buffer_resource res;
        std::experimental::pmr::vector<int> v2(&res);
        foo(v2);

- [**N3920**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3920.html "Extending shared_ptr to Support Arrays, Revision 2") proposes to add array support to `shared_ptr`, via the syntax `shared_ptr<T[]>` and `shared_ptr<T[N]>`, alike those of `unique_ptr`.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        std::experimental::shared_ptr<double[]> p1(new double[n]);
        std::experimental::shared_ptr<double[1024]> p2(new double[1024]);

        p1[x] = p2[x] = /*...*/;


- [**N3921**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3921.html "string_view: a non-owning reference to a string, revision 7") proposes `string_view`,  a read-only reference to a &mdash;non-null-terminated&mdash; contiguous sequence of characters. It's a drop-in replacement of `std::string const&`, as it implements all of `std::string`'s const member functions &mdash;even the cruft&mdash;.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        void okayish(std::string const&){ /*...*/ }
        constexpr void better(std::experimental::string_view){ /*...*/ }

        okayish("yadda yadda yadda"); // std::string temporary allocates memory
        better("yadda yadda yadda"); // no memory allocation

- [**N3925**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3925.pdf "A sample Proposal, v4") proposes `sample`, an algorithm for random sampling &mdash;picking a given number of elements from a range&mdash;

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        std::vector<int> const population = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};        
        std::vector<int> sample;

        std::random_device rd;
        std::mt19937 g(rd());
        std::experimental::sample(
          population.begin(), population.end(),
          std::back_inserter(sample), 3, g);

- [**N3932**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3932.htm "Variable Templates For Type Traits (Revision 1)") proposes to add variable templates with a `_v` suffix as a less verbose synonym for type traits that yield a `::value`.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        static_assert(std::experimental::is_same_v<short, 
          std::tuple_element_t<2, std::tuple<long, int, short, char>>>);

The draft included facilities for network byte order conversion, proposed by [**N3787**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3783.pdf "Network Byte Order Conversion"), but those did not survive the ballot. The concern was that the corresponding POSIX facilities &mdash;`htonl`, `htons`, `ntohl` and `ntohs`&mdash; may be defined as macros, possibly resulting in conflicts when defining and/or calling such functions.

But it doesn't end there...

### Library Fundamentals v2

As soon as the Library Fundamentals TS was ready, [version 2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4336.html "Working Draft, C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals, Version 2") was started.

- [**N4061**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4061.pdf "Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple, v3") proposes `gcd` and `lcm` algorithms, which calculate the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two integer values, respectively.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        static_assert(std::experimental::gcd(6, 15) == 3);
        static_assert(std::experimental::lcm(6, 15) == 30);

- [**N4076**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4076.html "A proposal to add a generalized callable negator (Revision 4)") proposes `not_fn`, a generalized callable negator facility.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        std::partition(v.begin(), v.end(), [f](auto& p) { return !f(p); }); // before
        std::partition(v.begin(), v.end(), std::experimental::not_fn(f)); // after

- [**N4257**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4257.html "Delimited iterators (Rev. 4)") proposes `ostream_joiner`, a class that acts like `ostream_iterator` except that the delimiter is only placed between output elements.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        std::vector<int> v = {1, 4, 6};

        // Prints "1, 4, 6, "
        std::copy(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 
          std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, ", "));

        // Prints "1, 4, 6"
        std::copy(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 
          std::experimental::make_ostream_joiner(std::cout, ", "));

- [**N4273**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4273.htm "Uniform Container Erasure (Revision 2)") proposes `erase` and `erase_if`, uniform facilities to eliminate elements from a container, which takes different forms for different kind of containers.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4};

        v.erase(std::remove_if(v.begin(), v.end(), /*...*/), v.end()); // before
        std::experimental::erase_if(v.begin(), v.end(), /*...*/); // after

- [**N4282**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4282.pdf "A Proposal for the World’s Dumbest Smart Pointer, v4") proposes `observer_ptr`, a &mdash;not very&mdash; smart pointer that takes no ownership for the objects it observes.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        void raw(int*);
        void observer(std::experimental::observer_ptr<int>);

        int x = 42;
        raw(&x); // fine?
        observer(std::experimental::make_observer(&x)); // fine!

## Parallelism

The [Parallelism TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4104.html "Working Draft, Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Parallelism") also went through its first round of international ballot. It provides a series of algorithms with parallel execution semantics; some of them are counterparts of the existing algorithms, while others are new.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        std::vector<int> vec = /*...*/;

        // explicit sequential sort
        std::experimental::parallel::sort(
          std::experimental::parallel::seq, vec.begin(), vec.end());

        // parallel sort
        std::experimental::parallel::sort(
          std::experimental::parallel::par, vec.begin(), vec.end());

        // vectorized sort
        std::experimental::parallel::sort(
          std::experimental::parallel::par_vec, vec.begin(), vec.end());

        // sort with dynamically-selected execution
        size_t threshold = /*...*/;
        std::experimental::parallel::execution_policy exec =
          std::experimental::parallel::seq;
        if(vec.size() > threshold) {
          exec = std::experimental::parallel::par;
        }
        std::experimental::parallel::sort(exec, vec.begin(), vec.end());

## Transactional Memory

The [Transactional Memory TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4301.pdf "Working Draft, Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Transactional Memory") is currently in its first round of international ballot. It provides language constructs for [transactional memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory "Transactional memory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"), a form of optimistic speculation in which transactions are allowed to run concurrently but must yield a result equivalent to that of some sequential execution &mdash;they appear to execute atomically&mdash;. Transactions are represented by `atomic` blocks, which shall not execute transaction-unsafe code. Additionally, it provides `synchronized` blocks which execute _as-if_ holding a global mutex.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
        int r1 = 0, r2 = 0, r3 = 0;
        std::thread t1([]{
          atomic_noexcept { // or atomic_commit/atomic_cancel
            a = 2;
            b = a + 1;
            c = b + 1;
          }
        });
        std::thread t2([]{
          atomic_noexcept {
            r1 = a;
            r2 = b;
            r3 = c;
          }
        });

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        // either r1 == 1, r2 == 2, r3 == 3,
        // or r1 == 2, r2 == 3, r3 == 4

## Concepts

The [Concepts TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4040.pdf "Working Draft, C++ Extensions for Concepts") will be heading for its first round of international ballot soon. It provides language extensions that enable the specification and checking of constraints on template arguments, and the ability to overload functions and specialize templates based on those constraints.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        template <typename C>
        concept bool Container() {
          return requires(C c) {
            typename C::value_type;
            typename C::iterator;
            /*...*/
            { c.begin() } -> C::iterator;
            { c.end() } -> C::iterator;
            /*...*/
          };
        }

        template <typename T> requires Container<T>
        void foo(T const&); // or,

        template <Container T>
        void foo(T const&); // or,

        void foo(Container const&);

## Concurrency

The [Concurrency TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4107.html "Working Draft, Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Concurrency") is still in flux. The working draft currently includes extensions for futures that make them composable &mdash;`.then` and friends&mdash;, and its likely to incorporate latches, barries, and atomic smart pointers soon. Executors, which were part of the original working draft, were removed due to concerns with their design &mdash;but may return in a different form&mdash;.

        [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
        void answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything() { return 42; }

        std::experimental::future<int> f1 =
            std::experimental::async(&answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything);

        /*...*/

        std::experimental::future<std::string> f2 = f1.then([](auto f) {
          return std::to_string(f.get()); // here .get() won't block
        });

        /*...*/

        std::cout << f2.get();


## That's it?

This is by no means an exhaustive list! Furthermore, there's plenty of work in the pipeline &mdash;not yet approved into a working draft&mdash;, targeting the standard itself or one of the several TSes.

- The Networking TS was rebooted; there was a request to update a networking proposal for TR2 &mdash;based on [Boost.Asio](http://www.boost.org/doc/html/boost_asio.html "Boost.Asio") &mdash;, which is now [**N4332**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4332.html "Networking Library Proposal (Revision 3)").

- Concurrency is looking at facilities like coroutines and fibers &mdash;light threads of execution&mdash;, as proposed by [**N4286**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4286.pdf "Resumable Functions (revision 3)"), [**N4232**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4232.pdf "Stackful Coroutines and Stackless Resumable Functions") and [**N4244**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4244.pdf "Resumable Lambdas: A language extension for generators and coroutines").

- Ranges are coming to the standard library town, as proposed by [**N4128**](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4128.html "Ranges for the Standard Library, Revision 1").

- ...and [much, much more](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/ "ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21 - Papers 2014").

During 2014, the _**C++** lands_ grew bigger at an outstanding rate! As the _TS_ model &mdash;which allows to decouple and publish work independently from the standard&mdash; is proving to be a success, 2015 it's certainly looking to be a good year for **C++**...
