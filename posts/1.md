There was once a [blog][p1] about a series of tales, memories gathered during a never-ending journey of **C++** development, a recollection of advice helpful to those navigating these wild lands. The whispers went quieter, and for a while no more tales where heard... It’s once again an exciting time for **C++**, and with that the whispers awakened and got louder one more time. And so, I decided it was the right time to reboot that blog; time to record new tales but also to review the ones already told.

# It's an exciting time for **C++**

A lot has happened in the last few years.

- The **C++0x** standard was approved by _ISO_ on _12 August 2011_ and published soon after, finally turning that **x** into an **11**. There have been no end of jokes about the **x** being _hexadecimal_, but the standard has came to be officially known as **C++11**. Popular implementations are rapidly including more and more features of this new standard, and the remaining ones are expected to arrive in the short future (check [here][1] for a regularly updated detailed list).

- **C++** now has a home on the web at [isocpp.org][2], it both aggregates the best **C++** content and hosts new content itself. There you can find about news, status and discussion about the **C++** standard on all compilers and platforms.

- We now have a [Standard **C++** Foundation][3], a non-profit organization whose purpose is to support the **C++** software developer community and promote the understanding and use of modern Standard **C++** on all compilers and platforms. Quoting from their webpage, _two near-term goals of that mission are:_
    
    > 1. To promote dissemination of correct and up-to-date information about modern C++.
    > 2. To promote greater availability of high-quality C++ libraries, including both standard libraries (by reducing barriers to submitting and adopting libraries in Standard C++ itself) and community libraries (by having an organized, and ideally tool-supported, way for C++ developers to discover and use libraries).

And there were even a few things that _didn't_ happened &mdash;I'm looking at you, `Concepts`&mdash;.

# What's new

We all know by now that `Concepts`, which were supposed to be the revolutionary new feature, didn't make it into the standard. There was no consensus whether concepts should be _implicit_ or _explicit_, and no existing practice to steer the discussion in one way or another. The end result was that `Concepts` were deemed _not ready_ for **C++11**.

So what **is** new? A plethora of useful features working together to change the way we write and think about code. 

## Move semantics
    
_Rvalue references_ are non-const references to temporaries, also known as _rvalues_ for often lying on the right side of an assignment. While they do make room for important optimizations &mdash;specially in those cases not covered by [_Copy Elision_][copy_elision]&mdash;, they are not a mere _optimization_ but the foundational stone for implementing _move semantics_. _Move semantics_ is how we naturally deal with objects in the real world. Think of it, if you need to move a chair from one place to another you just move it, you do not create a copy of the chair at the destination and then destroy the original chair. _Move semantics_ let us state clearly and directly that our intention is to transfer an object's from one place to another, with the side effect that the operation will be as efficient as possible.

Even more, there is a subset of types for which making a copy makes no sense &mdash;think streams or the newly introduced `std::thread`&mdash;; objects of such types are _uncopyable_. This implies that their state used to be effectively tied to a particular instance, and  their usability used to be limited due to moves being approximated by copies; _i.e._, they couldn't be held in containers. With _move semantics_, the state of an object can be detached from its instance, so that we no longer need to workaround artificial limitations by storing them in dynamic memory and dealing with them through pointers.

The previous paragraphs show us how _move semantics_ make us think differently, but what about performance? Without _move semantics_, moving a value from one place to another entails making a copy of the original value and discarding the original value afterwards, which while logically correct is inefficient due to the unnecessary copies and destructions performed. _Move semantics_ allow for stealing the internal resources of a temporary value, instead of duplicating them, given that the original resources will no longer be used afterwards. The notion has always been around in the _Standard Library_, embedded into algorithms that have to _move_ objects from one place to another, albeit using `swap`. With _move semantics_, canonical `swap` involves no copies for movable objects &mdash;we don't intend to copy any object after all, just change their places&mdash;, and is now implemented like this:

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template< typename T > 
    void swap( T& a, T& b )
    {
      T tmp = move( a );
      a = move( b );
      b = move( tmp );
    }

_Rvalue references_, along with some changes to the wording for _lvalue references_, also allow for _perfect forwarding_. This is the possibility for a function to forward its arguments to some other function exactly as they were received; something that previously required `2^N` overloads for the `N`-argument case.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template <class T, class A1, class A2>
    shared_ptr<T> factory(A1&& a1, A2&& a2) {
      return shared_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<A1>(a1), std::forward<A2>(a2)));
    }

## Generalized constant expressions
    
The notion of _constant expressions_ has been generalized to include function calls. _Limited recursion_ is allowed _(up to at least 512 nested invocations)_, which does not cripple the computational power of `constexpr` functions in lue of the requirement for them to be of the simple form `return expr;`.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    constexpr int square(int x)
        { return x * x; } // OK
    constexpr long long_max()
        { return 2147483647; } // OK
    constexpr int abs(int x)
        { return x < 0 ? -x : x; } // OK
    constexpr void f(int x) // error: return type is void
        { /∗ ... ∗/ }
    constexpr int prev(int x)
        { return --x; } // error: use of decrement
    constexpr int g(int x, int n) { // error: body not just “return expr”
        int r = 1;
        while (--n > 0) r *= x;
        return r;
    }

## Simpler ways to write code

### Type inference

Previously, the type of a variable had to be explicitly specified in order to use it. Now, the definition of a variable with an explicit initialization can use the `auto` keyword and its type will be deduced to the specific type of the initializer. Additionally, the `decltype` keyword can be used to determine the type of an expression at _compile-time_.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    decltype(5) x = 5; // OK: x has type int
    static decltype(0.0) y = 0.0; // OK: y has type double
    
    auto x = 5; // OK: x has type int
    static auto y = 0.0; // OK: y has type double
    auto int r; // error: auto is not a storage-class-specifier

### Range-based for-loop
    
The _Range-based `for`-loop_ is syntactic sugar for iterating over a _range_. A _range_ is either an array or a class that defines `begin()/end()` functions, either as member functions or as free functions discoverable by _argument-dependent lookup_.
    
    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    int array[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    for (int& x : array)
      x *= 2;

### Lambda functions and expressions

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to create simple function objects. A _lambda function_ can refer to identifiers declared outside the lambda function; the set of these variables is commonly called a closure. 

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    void abssort(float *x, unsigned N) {
        std::sort(x, x + N,
            [](float a, float b) {
                return std::abs(a) < std::abs(b);
            });
    }

### `default` and `delete`d functions

The generation of special member functions can be explicitly defaulted or deleted.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    struct noncopyable {
        noncopyable() = default; // default constructor
        noncopyable(const noncopyable&) = delete; // no copy-constructor
        noncopyable& operator=(const noncopyable&) = delete; // no assignment operator
    };

### Initializer lists
    
_POD_ types can be initialized by means of an _initializer-list_ &mdash;a construct inherited from **C**&mdash;, in which a struct or array is given a list of arguments in curly braces in the order of the members' definitions. This construct has been extended so that it can be used for all classes. It is bound to the `std::initializer_list< T >` template class, which is a lightweight proxy object that provides access to an array of objects of type `T`. When a constructor takes a single `std::initializer_list` argument its considered an _initializer-list-constructor_, a type of constructor treated specially during _uniform initialization_.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    struct A {
      A(std::initializer_list<double>);
    };
    A a{ 1.0,2.0 };

### Uniform initialization
    
There are several ways to initialize types, and they do not all produce the same results when interchanged. There is now a syntax that allows for fully uniform type initialization that works on any object; it expands on the initializer list syntax, in which a struct or array is given a list of arguments in curly braces in the order of the members' definitions. If a class has an initializer list constructor, then it takes priority over other forms of construction.

### Variadic templates

Templates can take variable numbers of template parameters.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    template<typename... Values> class tuple;

They also allows the definition of type-safe variadic functions.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]    
    // no parameters overload
    template void printf(std::string const& format);
    
    // generic overload, consumes one parameter and calls printf recursively
    template< typename T, typename ...Params >
    template void printf(std::string const& format, T&& value, Params&&... params);

### Relaxed restrictions

The _Plain Old Data_ _(POD)_ concept was divided into two separate concepts: _Trivial_ and _Standard-Layout_. With this separation it becomes possible to give up one concept without losing the other. A _trivial_ type value can be statically initialized, and it is legal to copy it via `memcpy`. Its lifetime begins when its storage is defined, not when one of its constructor completes. A _standard-layout_ type orders and packs its members in a way that is compatible with **C**. A _POD_ type is one that is _trivial_, _standard-layout_, and for which all of its non-static data members and base classes are _PODs_.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    struct N { // neither trivial nor standard-layout
      int i;
      int j;
      virtual ~N();
    };
    struct T { // trivial but not standard-layout
      int i;
    private:
      int j;
    };
    struct SL { // standard-layout but not trivial
      int i;
      int j;
      ~SL();
    };
    struct POD { // both trivial and standard-layout
      int i;
      int j;
    };

`Unions` are no longer restricted to _POD_ types only, they can now contain objects that have a non-trivial constructor.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    union U {
      int i;
      float f;
      std::string s;
    };

# That's it?

This is by no means an exhaustive list! The _C++ lands_ are wide, and only as we venture deep into them we discover both new idioms and new dark corner cases.

So hear what the tales have to say, and step into these lands...
