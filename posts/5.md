[Episode Three](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/post-4/Episode-Three-Friends-with-Benefits "Episode Three: Friends with Benefits") tells us about friendship, and how it can be used to narrow access to a class or function. However, that's not the only thing friendship restricts, it also restricts how we may use such class or function. What follows is a concrete example of how friendship may cramp your style.

# The service & session situation

While working on a service, any kind of stateful service, there is often the need to represent its sessions as separate objects. Such sessions would be aggregates of all the necessary information needed to represent a service session, which is entirely tied to the implementation of the service they are part of. The coupling introduced by this particular use of friendship will not be an issue; sessions are, in a way, subobjects of the service as they can only exist within a service.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class service;

    class session
    {
      friend service;

      session( session const& ) = delete; // non-copyable
      session( session&& ) = delete; // non-movable
      :::
    };

A `session` is not _copyable_, copying simply makes no sense. It isn't _movable_ either, not because it follows from the design but for external constraints &mdash;lets just say it holds an object of a _non-movable_ type, like [`std::mutex`][std::mutex]&mdash;.

## Construction

Given that a `session` can only be created by a `service`, it appears to make sense to set it up with a `private` constructor.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class session
    {
      :::
    private:
      session( service& s ){ ::: }
      :::
    };

The only one that can create `session`s &mdash;besides `session` itself&mdash;, is its one friend the `service`.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class service
    {
      :::
      void new_connection()
      {
        auto s = new session( *this );
        /** stash the new session somewhere... **/
      }
      :::
    };

## What about utility functions?

But maybe you have read [Herb Sutter's advice][GotW102] on exception-safe function calls &mdash;and if you haven't, you should&mdash;, and you know that a _raw pointer_ is not the best tool for the job. A `unique_ptr` would be a better choice.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class service
    {
      :::
      void new_connection()
      {
        auto s = make_unique< session >( *this );
        /** stash the new session somewhere... **/
      }
      :::
    };

And then the darkness: `make_unique` cannot construct a new `session`, only a `service` can do that. In order for `make_unique` to be able to construct a new `session`, it would have to be one of its friends too.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class session
    {
      :::
      template<typename T, typename ...Args>
      friend std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique( Args&& ...args );
      :::
    };

This in fact works &mdash;at least for now&mdash; but it doesn't solve the problem, it just pushes it a bit further. Note that `make_unique` is unqualified, as it is not _yet_ part of the language. It is/would be the `unique_ptr` counterpart to `shared_ptr`'s [`std::make_shared`][std::make_shared]. Quoting the referred _Guru of the Week_ article:

> That **C++11** doesn’t include `make_unique` is partly an oversight, and it will almost certainly be added in the future. In the meantime, use the one provided below.)
>
>     [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
>     template<typename T, typename ...Args>
>     std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique( Args&& ...args )
>     {
>       return std::unique_ptr<T>( new T( std::forward<Args>(args)... ) );
>     }

**C++14** draft has become ready since the time that article was posted, and `make_unique` is now part of the standard library. Quoting from [ISO C++ Spring 2013 Meeting][c++-spring-2013]:

> One of the smallest additions is actually great in its impact. It’s `make_unique`:
>
>     [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
>     auto u = make_unique<some_type>( constructor, parameters, here );
> 
> The reason `make_unique` has important impact is that now we can teach C++ developers to mostly never use explicit `new` again. In C++11 we already could teach to never use raw pointers and explicit `delete` again, except in rare cases that are hidden inside a class in order to do something like implement a low-level data structure. However, we could not teach to never write `new` because although `make_shared` was provided to create a `shared_ptr`, `new` was still needed to create a `unique_ptr`. Now, instead of “`new`”, write `make_unique` or `make_shared`.

### A note on lambdas

Lambda functions allows an anonymous function object to be defined in place. They are not just syntactic sugar, they are a special construction. A particular property of these constructions is that the body of a lambda function is considered as if it were in the context where the lambda is being introduced. This means, among other things, that code within a lambda function is granted the same level of friendship than code right outside of it. 

> **[5.1.2/7]**
> The _lambda-expression_’s _compound-statement_ yields the _function-body_ (8.4) of the function call operator, but for purposes of name lookup (3.4), determining the type and value of `this` (9.3.2) and transforming _id-expression_ s referring to non-static class members into class member access expressions using `(*this)` (9.3.1), the `compound-statement` is considered in the context of the `lambda-expression`. [ _Example:_

>     struct S1 {
>       int x, y;
>       int operator()(int);
>       void f() {
>         [=]()->int {
>           return operator()(this->x + y); // equivalent to S1::operator()(this->x + (*this).y)
>           // this has type S1*
>         };
>       }
>     };
>
> _—end example_ ]

## What about utility functions' utility functions?

There is no guarantee nor requirement that a standard `make_unique` would have to be as simple as our provisory implementation is; as there isn't such requirement in the standard now for `make_shared`. Let's assume that a `session` will take care of its own lifetime, instead of having the `service` take care of it, and move to using `shared_ptr`s instead.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class session : std::enable_shared_from_this< session >
    {
      :::
      template<typename T, typename ...Args>
      friend std::shared_ptr<T> std::make_shared( Args&& ...args );
      :::
    };

    class service
    {
      :::
      void new_connection()
      {
        auto s = std::make_shared< session >( *this );
      }
      :::
    };

This no longer works &mdash;not in a portable way&mdash;, even though we have befriended the right function. The actual construction of the new `session` can potentially be done within any other function directly or indirectly called by `make_shared`. It is just the same problem initially shown for our provisonary `make_unique`, except that we no longer have control over it.

## What about optimizations?

So it seems that the only safe decision would be to resign to any utility function and have the `service` be the one that creates the `session`, since its the only one allowed to.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class service
    {
      :::
      void new_connection()
      {
        auto s = std::shared_ptr< session >( new session( *this ) );
      }
      :::
    };

This once again works, and it seems to be doing the same thing we intended before. But it isn't. This approach performs two memory allocations: one for the explicit `new` in the code, and one for the internal _reference count_ of the `shared_ptr` within its constructor. The `make_shared` approach, on the other hand, will allocate a single block of memory in which it will keep both the internal _reference count_ and the newly constructed object. Here is the relevant paragraph of the standard regarding `make_shared`:

> **[20.7.2.2.6/6]**
> _Remarks:_ Implementations should perform no more than one memory allocation. [ _Note:_ This provides efficiency equivalent to an intrusive smart pointer. _—end note_ ]

This also allows a second optimization that reduces the control block by the size of one pointer. _Stephan T. Lavavej_ calls it the _We Know Where You Live_ optimization, which explains at his [STL11: Magic && Secrets][STL11-Magic-Secrets] panel on _GoingNative 2012_.

## (A) Solution

The problem started when we gave `session` a `private` constructor, as they can only be created by `service`s. Actually, we don't care who does create a new `session`, as long as it is on behalf of a `service`. The simplest solution would be to make the constructor `public`, and make it an implementation detail.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    namespace detail {
      class session : std::enable_shared_from_this< session >
      {
      public:
        session( service& s ){ ::: }
        :::
      };
    } // namespace detail

    class service
    {
      :::
      void new_connection()
      {
        auto s = std::make_shared< detail::session >( *this );
      }
      :::
    };

The compiler will no longer restrict access to `session`, but placing it in a `detail` namespace should signal the user this is an implementation detail &mdash;`impl` is another name commonly used&mdash;. We have changed a contract with the compiler for one with the user, which we cannot enforce. This is an acceptable solution since we are guarding against Murphy, not Machiavelli.

If we wish to have the compiler enforce this new contract, we can use a combination of the approaches introduced in the previous episode. We will split a `session` into its public interface and the interface available for the service to consume; and we will use an `access_key` so that the construction of a `session` can be indirectly performed when a `service` requests it.

    [[syntax: cpp, gutter: false; toolbar: false;]]
    class session : std::enable_shared_from_this< session >
    {
      :::
    protected:
      session( service& s ){ ::: }
      :::
    };

    namespace detail {
      class session_impl : session
      {
      public:
        session_impl( service& s, access_key< service > ) : session{ s } { ::: }
        :::
      };
    } // namespace detail

    class service
    {
      :::
      void new_connection()
      {
        /** only a service can create an access_key< service >, but anyone can copy or move it afterwards **/
        auto s = std::make_shared< detail::session_impl >( *this, access_key< service >{} );
      }
      :::
    };
